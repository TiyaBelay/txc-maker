This is a tool for making content for the [Translation Cards](https://github.com/translation-cards/translation-card) app. The goal is to allow humanitarians and translators to make relevant and accurate translations available to aid workers using Translation Cards in the field. The content (decks) made by this tool should follow [this specification](https://github.com/translation-cards/translation-cards/blob/master/docs/txc.md).

See the [setup](https://github.com/translation-cards/txc-maker/blob/master/docs/setup.md) document for details on how to set up the development environment.

See the [workflow](https://github.com/translation-cards/txc-maker/blob/master/WORKFLOW.md) document for details on how we develop for this tool.
